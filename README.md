## üìö Essential Tools:

### 1. Code Editor
To write and test your JavaScript code, you‚Äôll need a code editor. The recommended one is:

- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A powerful, free code editor with lots of features for JavaScript development.

### 2. Web Browser
JavaScript runs in web browsers, so having a good one is essential for testing your code.

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): A popular browser with built-in developer tools for debugging JavaScript.
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/): Another excellent browser with great developer tools.

### 3. Node.js
Node.js allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser, which is useful for server-side programming and running JavaScript tools.
